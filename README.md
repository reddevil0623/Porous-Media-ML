Algebraic Topology and Machine Learning for Flow in Porous Media Code
This repository contains the code for Haochen Yang's Master dissertation project on the application of algebraic topology and machine learning to model flow in porous media.
The code in this repository is written in Python and uses various open-source libraries such as Giotto-tda, scikit-learn, and scikit-fmm.
The functions.py file contains codes for all self-defined functions used during the experiments for this dissertation.
